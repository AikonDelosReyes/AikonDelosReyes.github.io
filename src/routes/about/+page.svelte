            <p>
                My journey as a BSIT student at Gordon College has been an exciting blend of learning, challenges, and growth. I’m currently in my third year, diving deep into software development, and each day feels like a step closer to my dream of becoming a skilled IT professional. The hands-on projects and collaborative environment at Gordon have allowed me to explore web development using cutting-edge frameworks like Svelte, React, and more.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Outside of my studies, I find balance by working on personal projects that help me hone my skills. These side projects have sparked my passion for creating applications that can benefit healthcare and improve people’s lives, which is something I aim to pursue professionally.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                My personal life is also a huge part of who I am. Whether it's enjoying time with friends, reading the latest tech blogs, or participating in hackathons, I always find ways to stay inspired. My experience as a student has been an enriching blend of academic rigor, personal development, and community involvement. It's been a journey of discovery, both in and out of the classroom, and I’m excited to see where it takes me next.
            </p>
